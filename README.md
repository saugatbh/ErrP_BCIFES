# ErrP_BCIFES
The codes that detect error feedback when the participants receive visual or somato-sensory feedback . The methodology implements optimal transport to transport source data samples within the distribution of the target data samples. This allows for cross-subject training and hence, does not require re-training for new participants or sessions.
